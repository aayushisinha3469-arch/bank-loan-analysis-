Bank Loan Analysis (Jupyter Notebook) -  This project uses Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly) to analyze the "financial_loan.xlsx" dataset. It calculates KPIs (funded amount, interest rate, DTI), segments loans (Good/Bad) to assess risk, and visualizes trends by month, state, loan purpose, and home ownership.
